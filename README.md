# Full Stack Project: NOC Management Portal

## Description

The NOC Management Portal is a full-stack application designed to streamline the management, verification, and documentation of No Objection Certificates (NOCs) within an organization. The system provides an intuitive interface for administrators and users while integrating robust backend functionality to handle authentication, file uploads, PDF generation, and secure data management.

This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to offer a scalable, user-friendly, and efficient platform.

## Features
### Frontend (React.js)
1. Interactive User Interfaces

Intuitive and dynamic design for user interaction.
Real-time updates based on admin operations.

2. Routing and Navigation

Multi-page routing using react-router-dom.
Pages include login, dashboards, and NOC verification forms.

3. File Uploads

Support for uploading and verifying NOC files.

4. Secure Session Management

Frontend integration with authentication for secure session handling.

5. Error Handling and Notifications

Responsive error messages and user feedback.

### Backend (Node.js, Express.js)

1. Authentication

User and admin roles with secure login using Passport.js.
Password hashing with bcrypt.

2. Session Management

Sessions stored securely in MongoDB using connect-mongo.

3. Database Management

MongoDB for storing user, session, and NOC-related data.
Mongoose schemas for efficient data structure and retrieval.

4. File Upload and Storage

Handles file uploads via Multer.

5. PDF Generation

Generates NOC documents dynamically using PDFKit.
## Technology Stack
### Frontend:
React.js: For building interactive user interfaces.
React Router: To handle navigation and routing.
Axios: For communicating with backend APIs.
### Backend:
Node.js: Server-side runtime for handling requests.
Express.js: Framework for routing and API development.
Passport.js: Authentication middleware for login security.
PDFKit: To generate and serve PDF files.
### Database:
MongoDB: NoSQL database for efficient data storage.
Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
## Workflow
### Admins

Login via a secure dashboard.
Upload NOC files and manage user data.
View and validate uploaded documents.
### Users

Verify NOC credentials via a dedicated portal.
View their NOC files or error messages upon failure.
## How It Works
### Frontend

Users interact with React-based forms and dashboards.
Axios communicates with backend APIs to send/receive data.
### Backend

APIs authenticate users and process file uploads.
Stores metadata in MongoDB and validates user roles.
### Database

MongoDB stores all user-related data securely.
PDF Generation

PDFs are dynamically created with details specific to the user/organization.
